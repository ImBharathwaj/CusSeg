1. Planning & Requirements

    Define MVP scope: List the core backend features youâ€™ll build first (ingestion, storage, validation).

    Select key data types and sources: Such as JSON, CSV, API payloads, and webhooks.

    Map data flows: Use simple bullet points or diagrams to clarify how data moves from ingestion to storage.

    Decide the stack: Scala (with frameworks like Akka HTTP, Play Framework, or http4s), Kafka (for streaming), MongoDB/Cassandra, and S3 for storage are popular and proven choices with Scala.

    Compliance: Write out basic privacy/consent needs if required.

2. Environment & Repository Setup

    Version control: Initialize a GitHub/GitLab repo.

    Directory structure: Organize code (e.g., src/main/scala/, test/, config/).

    Setup dev environment: Get SBT (Scala Build Tool), Docker, and Scala 2.13/3.x environment ready.

    Cloud storage: Create and configure a bucket on S3 (or similar) to store ingested data.

3. Core Ingestion API Development

    API specification: Draft endpoint specs (e.g., POST /ingest) for receiving JSON, CSV, or webhook data.

    Project scaffold: Use SBT and your chosen framework (Akka HTTP or Play) for project setup.

    REST endpoint: Implement HTTP endpoint to accept:

        Raw JSON

        File uploads (handle multipart for CSV)

        Webhook events (simple POSTs)

    Validation: Check payload type, basic structure, and size limits.

    Logging: Log every accepted or failed request (either to file or a simple DB).

4. Storage Connection

    Integrate S3/cloud bucket: Use a Scala-compatible S3 client (e.g., AWS Java SDK) to upload raw data.

    Basic DB logging: Use MongoDB (via official Scala driver) or Cassandra for lightweight auditing/logs of incoming data.

5. Monitoring & Testing

    Printing/logging: Use logging libraries like Logback or SLF4J for clear operational logs.

    Unit testing: Write simple tests with ScalaTest or Specs2 for ingestion endpoints.

    Health-check endpoint: Implement GET /health to quickly verify service status.

    Manual verification: Test endpoints using tools like curl or Postman.
