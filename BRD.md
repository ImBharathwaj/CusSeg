## 1. Product Vision

Deliver a fully functional, highly customizable Customer Data Platform (CDP) that empowers organizations to ingest, unify, segment, and activate customer data from any source or format. The platform must support complex business needs, robust identity resolution, and enable advanced audience targeting through powerful APIs and configurable workflows.

---

## 2. Objectives

- Ingest customer data from any source or format (JSON, CSV, XML, batch files, streaming, webhooks)
- Unify fragmented records into consolidated customer profiles using configurable, rule-based identity resolution
- Enable complex, flexible, rule-driven and nested segmentation for advanced audience management
- Provide secure, standardized API access for all core functions (ingest, query, segment, export)
- Ensure extensibility: support configuration, plugin logic, and third-party integrations
- Ensure platform can run locally in dev, but is cloud-ready for scale

---

## 3. Target Users

- Marketing and CRM teams seeking unified customer views
- Data analysts driving segmentation and reporting
- Growth and CX managers enabling personalized campaigns
- Technical teams integrating the CDP with martech stacks

## 4. Core Features & Scope

| Feature                       | Description                                                                                          |
|-------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Universal Data Ingestion**  | Accept JSON, CSV, XML, Avro, via API, batch, streaming, webhook                                      |
| **Data Processing**           | Configurable transformation pipelines, data enrichment, deduplication, validation, data quality logs |
| **Identity Resolution**       | Deterministic and probabilistic algorithms, custom merge rules, configurable matching keys           |
| **Segmentation**              | Rule-based, supports nested/complex, event-based & behavioral segmentation                           |
| **Data Storage & Retrieval**  | Pluggable backends: object storage, SQL/NoSQL for profiles & metadata, flexible schema support       |
| **Comprehensive API Layer**   | REST/GraphQL; versioned, secure, OpenAPI-based documentation                                         |
| **Customization Config**      | UI/API for configuring identity rules, mapping, retention, segmentation logic & plugins              |

## 5. User Stories

- _As a data engineer, I can integrate any data stream or batch file, validating format and quality as I ingest data into the CDP._
- _As a marketer, I can configure identity rules to unify fragmented customer records using my business’s unique keys._
- _As an analyst, I can define and save complex segmentation rules using all available customer attributes and behaviors._
- _As an operations/admin user, I can monitor usage, data flows, and investigate errors or audit logs through APIs and dashboards._
- _As an integrator, I can enable new connectors or plugins without core system redeployment._

---

## 6. Key Data Flows

1. **Data Source → API Gateway**: Data ingested via REST, streaming, or file upload
2. **API → Data Broker (e.g., Kafka)**: Buffers and distributes events workload
3. **Scala Processing Engine**: Transforms, cleans, enriches, validates, routes to storage
4. **Identity Resolution Engine**: Deduplicates, merges, and maintains unified profiles
5. **Segmentation Engine**: Applies rules to create real-time or scheduled segments
6. **API/Export Module**: Exposes profiles/segments via APIs or to external platforms

---

## 7. Success Metrics

- Ingestion supports all key formats and methods, with clear validation errors
- Identity engine maintains >95% match through configurable logic
- Segment creation and export can handle 1M+ profiles with sub-minute response
- All major operations log events, errors, and are discoverable via API or dashboard
- Every API endpoint protected with authentication and rate limiting

---

## 8. Constraints & Dependencies

- Local-first development, cloud migration through containerization (Docker/K8s)
- Early-stage persistence via MinIO (S3 API) and SQLite; scalable connectors for SQL/NoSQL as needed
- No ML-driven segmentation at launch, but pipeline is extensible for future ML modules
- UI/admin dashboard post-core API validation—API-first design

---

## 9. Known Risks

- Over-customizability could increase configuration complexity—must balance power with usability
- Distributed/data pipeline complexity may affect onboarding, monitoring, and troubleshooting for non-specialist teams
- Operational cost if multiple connectors/plugins are maintained without community or paid support

---

## 10. Glossary

- **Identity Resolution:** The process of merging duplicate/fuzzy-matching customer records from disparate sources
- **Segmentation:** Grouping of unified profiles by business rules or behavioral logic
- **Activation:** Delivering selected data or segments to downstream channels or platforms
- **Plugin/Customization:** Mechanism for extending core pipeline or segmentation with user-written logic
